Smith-Magenis Syndrome Gene Therapy
-----------------------------------

PhaseLab was originally developed for SMS gene therapy research:

- RAI1 haploinsufficiency causes circadian disruption
- CRISPRa can restore RAI1 expression
- Coherence metrics predict therapeutic efficacy

Key publications and resources:

- SMS Foundation: `www.smsfoundation.org <https://www.smsfoundation.org>`_
- RAI1 gene: NCBI Gene ID 10743

Protein Folding Coherence
-------------------------

Phase coherence correlates with protein folding reliability:

- High coherence proteins fold consistently
- Low coherence indicates folding instability
- Applications in protein engineering

Chronotherapy Optimization
--------------------------

Circadian-aware drug dosing:

- Multi-tissue circadian models
- Optimal dosing schedules
- AAV delivery timing

Research Collaborations
-----------------------

PhaseLab is used in collaboration with:

- Quantum computing research (IBM Quantum)
- Gene therapy development
- Circadian biology studies
